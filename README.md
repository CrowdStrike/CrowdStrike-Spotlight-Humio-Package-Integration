# CrowdStrike Spotlight Package Integration

This repository contains the consumer and shipper code driving data to the CrowdStrike Spotlight Humio Package

## Configuration File Example - run on linux VM
>
> This client is powered by CrowdStrike's [FalconPy SDK](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/falconpy).

## Configuration Example - Run in container

The application may be executed using container common settings may be provided by environment, cron or systemd can
be used to schedule the task

```bash
#run this command only once this volume is used to store the checkpoint
#docker volume create cwd-spotlight-data

docker run \
    -e HUMIO_HEC_URL=https://cloud.us.humio.com/api/v1/ingest/hec/raw  \
    -e HUMIO_HEC_TOKEN=<humiohectoken> \
    -e FALCON_CLIENT_ID=<client_id> \
    -e FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET=<client_secret> \
    --mount source=cwd-spotlight-data,target=/data \
    ghcr.io/crowdstrike/crowdstrike-spotlight-humio-package-integration/container:<version>
```
